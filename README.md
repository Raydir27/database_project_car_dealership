## Car Dealership Database Project

This repository contains the files for a DBMS project simulating a car dealership database. 

### Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a database for a car dealership. The database will store information about cars, customers, sales, and other relevant data points.

### Files

* **ER Diagrams** (`ER_Diag.png`, `ER_To_Table.png`): Entity-Relationship diagrams visually representing the database schema.
* **SQL Scripts** (`Tables.sql`, `Functions.sql`): Scripts to create the database tables and populate them with functions. 
* **Report** (`report.pdf`): A report documenting the project, including the database design, functionalities, and findings.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* A DBMS software (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Basic understanding of SQL

**Instructions:**

1. Import the `Tables.sql` script into your chosen DBMS to create the database structure.
2. (Optional) Add data to populate the tables using `Functions.sql`.
3. Refer to the `report.pdf` for detailed information about the project and database functionalities.

### Additional Information

* This README is a basic template. Feel free to modify it to include specific details about your project, such as the DBMS used and any additional functionalities implemented.
* Consider adding instructions on how to run queries or explore the data using your chosen DBMS interface.
